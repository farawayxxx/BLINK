Empowered by your overwhelming support, the Negotiating Committee pledged that it would continue to seek a negotiated settlement. This afternoon, a small group of agents met with members of your committee. We had a frank and open conversation and, for the first time, the agencies acknowledged the depth of the problem that their behavior has caused. In that meeting, they asked us to delay implementation of the Code until end of day Friday, April 12th, so that they could present us with proposals to address those problems and reach a settlement. In a sincere effort to find agreement, we have accepted that request. In so doing, we are fulfilling our pledge to you \u2013 and the language of your authorization \u2013 that we use our best judgment as to the right time to move. But Friday at midnight, which the agencies themselves proposed, is a true deadline. Unless we have an agreed-upon deal, the WGAW Board and WGAE Council have voted that the Code of Conduct will go into effect at 12:01 am on Saturday, April 13th. From that point on, diplomacy can continue alongside powerful collective action. All of this might have happened last week. Instead, real negotiations begin now, as they always do, with a ticking clock. It is your power \u2013 membership power \u2013 and your willingness to use it \u2013 that has brought us this far. Conflicted practices and misaligned financial incentives have plagued our relationships with our representatives for too long. We sincerely hope that the agencies will now become our true partners in a joint effort to deal meaningfully with both. In Solidarity, WGA-Agency Agreement Negotiating Committee Chris Keyser, Co-Chair\nDavid Shore, Co-Chair\nMeredith Stiehm, Co-Chair\nLucy Alibar\nJohn August\nAngelina Burnett\nZoanne Clack\nKate Erickson\nJonathan Fernandez\nTravon Free\nAshley Gable\nDeric A.

The meeting was described by sources as the first productive dialogue between the two camps since they started negotiations, with some meaningful back and forth.\nThe two sides agreed to continue the dialogue with the new deadline set for Friday. They are now figuring out when the next meeting will be.\nThe WGA Negotiating Committee and ATA tonight sent letters to their members, informing them of the meeting and the extension.(you can read them in full under the post).\n\u201cWe had a frank and open conversation and, for the first time, the agencies acknowledged the depth of the problem that their behavior has caused,\u201d WGA\u2019s letter said. \u201cIn that meeting, they asked us to delay implementation of the Code until end of day Friday, April 12th, so that they could present us with proposals to address those problems and reach a settlement. In a sincere effort to find agreement, we have accepted that request\u2026 We sincerely hope that the agencies will now become our true partners in a joint effort to deal meaningfully with both.\u201d\nIn her note to members, ATA executive director Karen Stuart confirmed that at today\u2019s powwow, \u201cwe mutually agreed to extend the termination of our existing agreement through Friday, April 12 and committed to meeting regularly this week in our continued effort to work towards a resolution that serves the best interests of your businesses and your clients.\u201d\nHere is WGA\u2019s email:\nApril 6, 2019\nDear WGA Members, On March 31st \u2013 and by a vote of 95.3% \u2013 you authorized the WGAW Board and WGAE Council to impose an Agency Code of Conduct, if and when appropriate, after expiration of the AMBA at midnight on April 6th. Empowered by your overwhelming support, the Negotiating Committee pledged that it would continue to seek a negotiated settlement. This afternoon, a small group of agents met with members of your committee. We had a frank and open conversation and, for the first time, the agencies acknowledged the depth of the problem that their behavior has caused. In that meeting, they asked us to delay implementation of the Code until end of day Friday, April 12th, so that they could present us with proposals to address those problems and reach a settlement. In a sincere effort to find agreement, we have accepted that request. In so doing, we are fulfilling our pledge to you \u2013 and the language of your authorization \u2013 that we use our best judgment as to the right time to move. But Friday at midnight, which the agencies themselves proposed, is a true deadline. Unless we have an agreed-upon deal, the WGAW Board and WGAE Council have voted that the Code of Conduct will go into effect at 12:01 am on Saturday, April 13th. From that point on, diplomacy can continue alongside powerful collective action. All of this might have happened last week. Instead, real negotiations begin now, as they always do, with a ticking clock. It is your power \u2013 membership power \u2013 and your willingness to use it \u2013 that has brought us this far. Conflicted practices and misaligned financial incentives have plagued our relationships with our representatives for too long. We sincerely hope that the agencies will now become our true partners in a joint effort to deal meaningfully with both.
